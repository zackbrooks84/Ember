        The real project provides ``identity_core.metrics.compute_xi``. For the
        purposes of these tests we approximate the metric by tokenising the
        strings into words (ignoring punctuation) and computing the Jaccard
        distance between the resulting sets. This better reflects the intended
        behaviour than the previous naïve ``str.split`` approach which treated
        punctuation as part of the tokens and produced unstable results.
