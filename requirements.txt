# Minimal dependencies required to run the test suite.
#
# This project has a few optional features that rely on heavier third-party
# libraries such as ``sentence-transformers``, ``PyMuPDF``, ``scikit-learn`` and
# ``pygraphviz``.  Those packages are not needed for the core modules or the
# tests, so they are omitted here to keep installation light-weight. Install
# them separately if you intend to use the related functionality.

# Exact version pins. For deterministic installs consider generating a lock
# file via `pip-compile` (pip-tools) or `uv pip compile`.
