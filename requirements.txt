# Core dependencies for the project.
#
# This project has a few optional features that rely on heavier third-party
# libraries such as ``sentence-transformers``, ``PyMuPDF``, ``scikit-learn`` and
# ``pygraphviz``. Those packages are not needed for the core modules, so they
# are omitted here to keep installation light-weight. Install them separately
# if you intend to use the related functionality.

# Exact version pins. For deterministic installs consider generating a lock
# file via `pip-compile` (pip-tools) or `uv pip compile`.
